# Introduction

Hello Gopher! If you want to contribute to this project, you've come to the right place. I just want to provide a little background to you about myself and this project since you've come this far and are considering helping with it.

If we're going to work together, it's really only fair you hear about who I am before deciding.

## About Me

I have no on the job experience as a programmer and am fully self-taught. It probably shows in my code but I'm trying to learn better practices all the time. If you decide to contribute and can see how I can do something better, then please let me know! We can talk about it and I can learn.

## Project Inspiration

Obviously this project is directly inspired by [nmap](https://nmap.org/). There's no doubt about that and I wouldn't even try to deny it if you asked. I just wanted a project that was related to an area I was interested in and that's cyber security, hacking and penetration testing that would allow me to:

- Learn Go
- Practice better Git practices (though this is still difficult for me lol)
- Add projects to my very bare Github that was in need of attention
- Just code something -- I enjoy working on personal projects and finding inspiration is hard and it's hard to keep going sometimes. Working on something I really enjoy helps keep me motivated


This project started as a personal "improve myself" project. But as I started working on it, I started to think that it could have some value to the CTF and hacking community as an altern

# How to Contribute

The flow for contributing to Open Source software is:

1. Fork the repo
2. Make changes
3. Submit Pull Request
4. Comment on the issue worked on

Github actually provides a nice [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) on how to contribute to a project. The steps are the same as above, but the Github guide provides more granular steps to each thing and how to do it in Github, if you're new.

## Tags to Look For

If you are wanting to add to the project, just browse through the [issues](https://github.com/0niSec/gomap/issues) and find one that tickles your fancy and get to work.

Issues tagged as "good first issue" or "help wanted" are good places to start, but being a single developer, I'm not going to gatekeep anyone that wants to work on whatever they want.

# Thank You

To those that do decide to help, thank you. Even if you do one commit or a hundred, thank you for working with me and showing me other coding practices, teaching me and improving Gomap to something better.
